Hello! I'm Bastián Soto Iturra (or Scarias for most people), and in the next paragraphs you going to get information about me and my skills.

## About me

My full name is *Bastián Nicolás Soto Iturra*, and I have 21 years old. I was born in October 14, 1999. I'm living in *Región de Valparaíso, Chile*.

I'm student from *Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María* (*UTFSM*), where I course Informatic Civil Engineering. I do personal projects for code skills improvement, and learn about how new technologies works.

I want to start working as a freelancer, but first I need to learn more things before. Stay tunned!

## Ideals

It's simple: I'm interested in make people happy with code, and improve their life's quality. I think we can do **anything** with programming, and I want to use that ideal to help my loved ones.

If your project or work has that objective, I would be happy to be part of that.
